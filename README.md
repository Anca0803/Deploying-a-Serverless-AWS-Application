#  Quotes API â€“ Serverless Project on AWS

This is a fully serverless web application that delivers random inspirational quotes using AWS services. The project is live and integrated into my personal AWS-hosted website:  
ðŸ‘‰https://anca-irimia.com/quotes.html

## What I Built:

- **Amazon DynamoDB** â€“ Stores 20+ inspirational quotes with a partition key (`quote`) and sort key (`author`). Auto-scaling is enabled with encryption at rest.
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Two Python-based functions:
  - `PutQuotes`: seeds the database with quotes.
  - `GetQuotes`: retrieves a random quote from DynamoDB.
- **Amazon API Gateway** â€“ REST endpoints for `/PutQuotes` and `/GetQuotes`, secured and integrated with Lambda.
- **Amazon S3 Website** â€“ Quotes are fetched and displayed on my front-end page hosted at anca-irimia.com
- **IAM & CloudWatch** â€“ Configured IAM roles with least-privilege access and enabled full request/response logging and X-Ray tracing for monitoring.

##  Key Learnings

- Hands-on experience designing, deploying, and securing a real-world serverless API.
- Practiced integrating backend AWS services with a live frontend website.
- Applied core concepts like IAM roles, API Gateway integrations, CORS, and CloudWatch monitoring.
